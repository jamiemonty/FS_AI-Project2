Strategy Description:
We use daily Adj Close prices to generate buy signals when the price falls below the lower Bollinger Band (20-day, 2σ), provided the deviation is >2% and volume >100k. Sell when the price crosses the SMA or after 30 days. Capital compounds after each trade.

GPT Prompt:
The goal is to create a python project that uses downloaded daily S&P500 ticker
data over the past 25 years (stock files are included in `YahooStockData/`). Use
GPT to find combinations of indicators to produce buy and sell signals and then
generate working Python code that:

- Backtests the strategy for a specific year (set by `theYear = 2024` at the
	top of the script so it is easy to change).
- Exposes indicator parameters as variables (e.g., `period`, `std_factor`, and
	`max_hold_days`) so you can tune them from the top of the file.
- Produces a trade spreadsheet with columns: Ticker, Buy Date, Buy Price, Sell
	Date, Sell Price, Percentage Profit, % Below Lower Band, Days Held, and
	saves it to `{theYear}_perf.csv`.
- Allows the variables to be tuned so the backtest yields a manageable number of
	trades (for example ~50 trades) when required.
- Generates candlestick charts (saved in `plots/`) using `mplfinance`, overlays
	Bollinger Bands and marks buy/sell signals clearly with dashed vertical lines.
